## 🕐 **EXPECTED TIMELINE**

### **Deployment Phases:**
- **0-2 minutes**: ✅ Code deployment and environment setup
- **2-5 minutes**: ⏳ Python dependencies installation  
- **5-8 minutes**: ⏳ TensorFlow model loading (current stage)
- **8-10 minutes**: ✅ Full service operational

### **Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Health endpoint: `https://rice-disease-detection-app-1.onrender.com/health`
- ⏳ `model_loaded: true` (waiting for this)
- ✅ All API endpoints responding correctly

## 📱 **YOUR APP STATUS**

### **Smart Fallback System (Active Now):**
```
1st Try: ☁️  Cloud API (deployment in progress)
2nd Try: 💻 Local API (works when laptop on)
3rd Try: 🏠 Development API (backup)
```

### **Current User Experience:**
- **With Laptop ON**: ✅ App works perfectly
- **With Laptop OFF**: ⏳ Will work once cloud deployment completes
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Graceful fallback, no crashes

---

## 🎯 **WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW**

### **While Waiting for Cloud (5-10 minutes):**
```bash
# Test your app with current setup
flutter run

# Take photos and test disease detection
# (Will use local API automatically)

# Prepare for global distribution
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### **Check Deployment Progress:**
```bash
# Run this every few minutes
python tmp_rovodev_check_deployment.py
```

### **When Cloud is Ready:**
```bash
# Build global APK
flutter build apk --release

# Test without laptop
# (Turn off laptop and test APK on phone)
```
