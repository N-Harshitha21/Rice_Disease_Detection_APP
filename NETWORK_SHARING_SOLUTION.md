# 📡 NETWORK SHARING SOLUTION - Let Other Devices Access Your API

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION FOR TESTING:**

Since cloud API is still loading, let's share your laptop's API with other devices:

---

## 🔧 **STEP-BY-STEP NETWORK SHARING:**

### **Step 1: Find Your Laptop's IP Address (30 seconds)**
```bash
# Windows:
ipconfig | findstr "IPv4"

# Example result: 192.168.1.100
```

### **Step 2: Update Firewall (1 minute)**
```bash
# Windows - Allow port 5000:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Python API" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5000
```

### **Step 3: Start API with Network Access (30 seconds)**
```bash
# Make sure your API is running and accessible
python rice_disease_api.py
```

### **Step 4: Test from Other Device (30 seconds)**
1. **Connect test device to same WiFi**
2. **Open browser on test device**
3. **Go to:** `http://YOUR_IP:5000/health` (replace YOUR_IP)
4. **Should show:** JSON response with API status

---

## 📱 **ALTERNATIVE: SIMPLE HOTSPOT METHOD**

### **Super Easy Setup (2 minutes):**
1. **Create WiFi hotspot** from your laptop
2. **Connect test devices** to your hotspot
3. **Your app will work** automatically on hotspot network
4. **All devices can access** your local API

### **Windows Hotspot:**
```bash
# Create hotspot:
netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid="RiceApp" key="test123"
netsh wlan start hostednetwork

# Your API will be accessible at: 192.168.137.1:5000
```
